    [Rust For Data Engineering]

    The “Rust for Data Engineering” course offers a comprehensive look into using
    * Rust for high-performance data engineering tasks. Here are the key takeaways:
    -> Understanding Rust's Unique Features: You'll start with an exploration of
        Rust's key features like HashMaps and vectors, which are foundational for creating efficient data structures.

    -> Safety, Security, and Concurrency: Rust's approach to safety, security, and concurrency
        is covered in detail, showcasing how Rust ensures secure and concurrent execution of tasks,
        which is crucial in data engineering for processing large datasets safely and efficiently.

    -> Practical Application with Libraries and Tools: The course delves into popular
        Rust libraries and tools for data engineering, providing hands-on experience in
        designing and implementing data processing systems.

    -> Building High-Performance Data Pipelines: Finally, you'll learn how to leverage
        Rust to build high-performance data pipelines, which can be applied in data engineering,
        ML Ops, and traditional software engineering.
